# This project was done based on a dataset of different cars in the United States. Descriptions including: price of the vehicle, model, type of car, odometer reading, how many days it's been listed, and its condition. Methods and libraries were pandas, numpy, and plotly express. The dataset was fairly simple to clean up considering there was not too much wrong with it in the first place. I did not have to deal with duplicate values and only had to sift through missing values. This included making sure that getting rid of or replacing those missing values was safe for the data. To launch the project you will first need to have Git installed. Then you can use, git clone https://github.com/jojorocoder/drhorrible.git. Alternatively you can download the ZIP file by clicking "Code" and selecting "Download ZIP".
